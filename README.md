## Project Proposal: Interactive Car Crash Map
### Created by:
#### Christina LaManna, Kady Epley, Amary Henry, Brandon Loredo

### Project Overview:
#### We propose to develop an interactive web-based map that visualizes and analyzes car crash data in Montgomery County, Maryland, for July 2023. This comprehensive map provides valuable insights into car crash incidents, including their locations, timing, and frequencies. By offering these visualizations, the map aims to raise public awareness, enhance road safety measures, and facilitate data-informed decisions.

### Project Features:
#### GeoMap Visualization: Car crash incidents for the entire month of July are displayed on the map. Each incident is represented by a marker with detailed information accessible upon clicking.

#### Bubble Chart: The bubble chart showcases the height of accidents during specific hours throughout the week. By visualizing this data, users can quickly understand patterns and trends in car crashes at different times.

#### Line Chart: The line chart displays the average number of accidents per day throughout the week. This feature allows users to identify the days with higher accident rates and make informed decisions accordingly.

### Data Source:
#### The car crash data will be sourced from the "Crash Reporting - Incidents Data" dataset provided by Montgomery County, Maryland. This dataset contains detailed information about each reported car crash, including date, time, location, crash type, road conditions, and more. The dataset will be used to populate the interactive map.

### Technology Stack:
#### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface and user interaction.
#### Data visualization libraries for presenting statistical insights.
##### Libraries:
###### Leaflet: used for creating interactive maps and markers.
#### ECharts: used to visualize hourly accidents per hour each day of the week (bubble chart) and the average accidents per day throughout the week (line chart). 

### Expected Impact:
#### This interactive car crash map will serve as a valuable resource for both the general public and local authorities. It will promote road safety awareness, inform drivers about high-risk areas and times, and facilitate data-driven decision-making by local law enforcement and traffic management authorities. By providing real-time insights into car crash incidents, the map aims to contribute to reducing car crashes and improving overall road safety in Montgomery County.
